            <h4>My Name Is Wada Jessica Ele-Ojo With School ID ALT/SOE/023/3177 </h4>
            <p> I was born on June 1st into a small, loving family, consisting solely of my doting parents.
                As the only child, i grew up with the undivided attention and support of my mom and dad, which played a
                significant role in shaping my vibrant and determined personality.

                <br>
            <p> My educational journey began at Fortune High School, where i exhibited my natural curiosity and
                enthusiasm for
                learning. My high school years were marked by my playful and joyful nature, earning me a reputation as

                during
                my university years that my headstrong and goal-oriented character truly shone. I pursued a degree in

                express
                myself artistically and connect with diverse audiences through digital platforms.

                elseâ€”Software
                Engineering. My passion for technology and coding had never waned, so i decided to make a career shift.
